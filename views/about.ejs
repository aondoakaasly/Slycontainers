    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="pl">
        Shipping containers transport 90-95% of the world’s goods. Without them, the global supply chain would <br>grind to a halt. Our reliance on them is incredible — but the way they’re traded isn’t.
The global container <br> trade is built on pen & paper processes. It takes a fragmented system of ledgers, emails, spreadsheets, <br> and phone calls to sell a single container. It’s fragile for suppliers. It's opaque for buyers. It’s broken for <br> everyone.
Boxhub's mission is to make the container trade easy and efficient for everyone by transforming <br> the shipping industry through technology. With our easy-to-use website and knowledgable sales team, <br> anyone can <a href="">buy a shipping container </a>with just a few clicks.
